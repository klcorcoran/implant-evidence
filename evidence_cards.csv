Prefer cemented all-poly for routine aTSA; use MBG with caution.,moderate,limited shoulder reporting,Registry collaboration shows higher revision when MBG used; excluding MBG equalizes stemless vs stemmed.,Narrative caution around MBG in annual reports; confirm per latest edition.,2025-09-29,shoulder;TSA
card_allpoly_any_5yr,feature,Cemented all-polyethylene glenoid (aTSA),5yr_all_cause_revision,Metal-backed glenoid (aTSA),Cemented all-poly glenoids remain the reference option for aTSA with favorable mid-term survivorship. Multiple SR/registry analyses report higher revision/failure with metal-backed glenoids; modern TM-backed RCTs show no superiority at 5 years. Prefer cemented all-poly for routine aTSA.,moderate,limited shoulder reporting,Registry collaboration indicates higher revision when metal-backed glenoids are used; all-poly performs best.,Annual report narratives caution on MBG; all-poly cemented widely used.,2025-09-29,shoulder;TSA
